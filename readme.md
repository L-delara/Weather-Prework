#Basic weather display app

- Using a search bar to take a city name, it runs through Open-Meteo's Geocoding API to pull the latitude/longitude coordinates to run through their Weather Forecast API. (Weather API only takes coordinates, not city names)
- Displays the city name, the current temperature in Farenheit, and the high and low temperatures for the day.

- If time allows, convert API's Weather Code into readable weather description ('sunny', 'rainy', etc)
- If time allows, find icons to display

##To Run:
